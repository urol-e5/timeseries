# E5 URoL physiology timeseries project 

### Abstract  

**Holobiont composition and seasonal plasticity in physiology are key to understanding reef building coral performance** 

The symbiotic relationship between corals and Symbiodiniaceae generates holobiont sensitivity to fluctuations in temperature, light, and nutrients, which change seasonally in tropical oceans. However, prior work examining coral stress response has occurred primarily without consideration of the current physiological state due to seasonal timing. Here, we tested the effect of seasonal variation on three dominant and ecologically important genera, *Acropora, Pocillopora*, and *Porites* (n=15 tagged colonies per site) in Moâ€™orea French Polynesia across three lagoon sites on the North shore in January, March, September, and December of 2020. We quantified physiological variables for the coral and Symbiodiniaceae, as well as molecular identification of the Symbiodiniaceae community and host species. Physiology of the three genera differed significantly. Variance partitioning analyses identified seasonal timepoint as the dominant explanatory factor for both host and symbiont responses, with a small influence of site. Acropora colonies were composed of *A. pulchra*, but we found cryptic haplotypes in *Pocillopora* (*P. meandrina, P. tuahiniensis*) and *Porites* (*P. evermanni, P. lobata/lutea*). Although physiology did not vary strongly between *Pocillopora* haplotypes, Porites haplotypes exhibited strong differences in physiological responses and were associated with distinct Symbiodiniaceae communities. Overall, across functional groups of dominant coral genera, seasonality is the strongest driver of physiological state and particular attention should be paid to cryptic species variation. These data provide an essential picture of the need for considering physiological state and its seasonality, particularly in light of the plethora of climate change related stress test assays taking place throughout the year.

## Navigating this repository 

This repository is organized such that each sampling time point (1 = January 2020, 2 = March 2020, 3 = September 2020, 4 = November 2020) has a dedicated folder with all metadata, data files, and scripts necessary for calculating physiological responses. All data output in these individual time points is then read in, assembled, and analyzed in the `time_series_analysis` directory.

### Running scripts 

**To run .Rmd scripts, set Knit directory to "Project Directory" prior to running full scripts. Restart your R environment prior to running scripts.** 

*To run all data from start to finish or re run all multivariate and univariate analyses after revising individual time point analyses:* 

1. Open the R project for the time points individually (e.g., `timepoint_1.Rproj` within each time point folder). Run all scripts in the `scripts` folders in individual time point folders. First run the `surface_area.Rmd` and then the `protein.Rmd` to generate output for normalizers needed in other data sets. Note that output of calculated metrics will be stored in the `output` folder within each time opint with the timepoint number in the file name: `1_surface_area.csv`. Run these scripts for all four time points in turn (timepoint 1, 2, 3, and 4). 

2. Open the `time_series_analysis.Rproj` project in the time series analysis folder. This project contains all scripts to read in data from each time point, conduct QC and metadata merging, and perform univariate and multivariate analyses. Run the scripts in this project in the numerical order they are named (e.g., `1_assemble_data.Rmd` then `2_univariate_analyses.Rmd`.   

*If you are looking to run individual steps of the analysis without changing any inputs, you can open and run scripts at any point in the workflow.*  

### Looking for colony metadata? 

QC'd colony metadata is available in the [time series analysis repository here](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries/blob/master/time_series_analysis/Output/master_timeseries.csv). It is critical to use this file for colony metadata. Colony metadata in individual time point folders includes errors and typos that are corrected in the time series analysis. 

Use the `colony_id_corr` column for the corrected colony_id.
